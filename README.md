1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  - In this course we were tasked with creating a program to help advisors of ABC University access course information for students. 


2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  - I first approached the problem by looking at what type of data we would be handling. Upon inspection of  the data I decided that a binary search tree would suit our use cases well. 


3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  - I overcame any roadblock I encountered while doing this project like reading data from a csv file in c++ by searching on google for people's solutions on this matter. Most of the time answers or pieces to the solution were found on stack overflow.


4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  - Before taking this course I had a general understanding of a lot of data structures and algorithms but might have overlooked certain metrics that would make one structure better than another. After taking this course I feel like I have a more nuanced understanding of the use cases of each of the structures we studied and how each might perform better under different circumstances. 


5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - Although many of the coding habits I have displayed through this course I have been practicing for a long time. I think that this course helped cement and reinforce many good coding habits like commenting and breaking code into manageable functions. I primarily code in java so this course also helped me hone my skills in c++. I also think that having a background in java when approaching this class allowed me to think of data structure and algorithm in a different way that can transcend coding languages.
